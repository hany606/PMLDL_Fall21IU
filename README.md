# PMLDL_Fall21IU
This repository is used to work on my assignments and homeworks in Practical Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at Innopolis University Fall 2021


## Assignment 1:

Implement a pipeline for Content-Based Image Retrieval using images embeddings based on InShop dataset, Pytorch was used to complete the assignment: [here](https://github.com/hany606/PMLDL_Fall21IU/blob/main/Assignment1/PMLDL_Assignment1.ipynb) 

Recall measurement was used in order to evaluate the model, the recall value was small as it was only trained for 50 epoch. In order to get higher recall value, hyperparameters must be fine-tuned and run the training for more epochs.
